    """
    Trains a scikit-learn pipeline, logs metrics to MLflow, and generates a SHAP summary plot.

    This function performs the following steps:
    - Loads the MLflow experiment configuration.
    - Sets the index of input DataFrames to 'date' for alignment.
    - Trains the provided pipeline on the training data.
    - Evaluates the trained pipeline on both training and test sets.
    - Logs accuracy metrics to MLflow.
    - Logs the trained model to MLflow.
    - Computes SHAP values (if supported) and generates a SHAP summary plot.

    Args:
        X_train (pd.DataFrame): Training feature matrix.
        y_train (pd.DataFrame): Training target vector.
        pipeline (pickle): A fitted scikit-learn pipeline that includes preprocessing and a final estimator.

    Returns:
        Tuple[pickle, plt.Figure]: The trained pipeline and a matplotlib figure object with the SHAP summary plot.
